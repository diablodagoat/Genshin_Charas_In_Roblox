# Genshin_Charas_In_Roblox
Recreating genshin chacracters using roblox studio


Important!!!:
These scripts are not meant to be reused as a combat script since they are made for the sole purpose for the recreation of the character and would probably only work to optimize their performance, Hit detections , replications , Rendering methods , are,all meant for that exact character and won't be as effective on an everyday combat system

this only holds the codes used in the creation of the character , no animations , no vfxes , no remotes , and I will not provide the structure of other components such as actors or Animation handlers
